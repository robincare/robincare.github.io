<p>Recently, I was out to lunch with a very close friend who had a double mastectomy. After each chemo treatment, once she was able to eat again, we’d meet for enchiladas at her favorite restaurant. As we were eating and chatting, she started laughing about something that happened at her daughter’s school the day before. She was having a great time talking to the teacher and other parents, until she realized one of her breast pads had slipped up and out of her shirt. It was stuck on her chest, right below her neck. She had no idea it had come out and, worse, no one had told her.</p> 

<p>Though she laughed as she told me this story, I could see the pain and humiliation in her eyes. She kept checking her chest during lunch, to make sure her breast pad hadn’t escaped again.</p>

<p>We finished lunch that day, hugged goodbye and went our separate ways. As I drove home, I couldn’t stop thinking about how awful that must have been for her during this already devastating time in her life. Not only did she have to deal with losing her breasts, now she had to police her chest for wayward pads. A few weeks later, I started working at Robin Care and was researching cancer resources for our own clients. When I came across Knitted Knockers, I had a giggle at the name but it drew me right in. This was exactly what my friend, as well as so many other cancer patients, needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.knittedknockers.org/" target="_blank">Knitted Knockers</a> is a group of volunteers who knit soft, comfortable prosthetics for breast cancer survivors. I immediately requested a complimentary pair of knockers for my friend. Within 24 hours, a volunteer contacted me to confirm my friends cup size and ask what color yarn she’d prefer.</p>

<p>About a week later, the package arrived in the mail. The hand knitted knockers were wrapped in pink tissue paper with a ribbon tied to each end. Along with it was a handwritten note. The personal detail and the love that goes into each set of Knitted Knockers prosthetics is very touching. I think the best part of Knitted Knockers is that the women who wear them begin to feel confident again — it boosts their self image and helps them not feel so “different.”</p>

<p>When I met up with my friend for our next post-chemo enchilada date, I presented her with her special gift. As she opened the package we both laughed until she started to cry.  She was so excited and so emotional that someone not only came up with this amazing replacement but that an someone knitted them just for her.</p>

<p>It was a very sweet moment and I felt like I was able to bring my friend a little bit of comfort during this part of her journey with breast cancer. She has been loving her knockers ever since and hasn’t had to police her chest for any more random escapees.</p>
